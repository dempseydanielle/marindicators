\title{Calculates the mean maximum age of fish in the community (Shin et al.,
 2010)}
\usage{
meanMaxAge(X, age.table, metric = "BIOMASS", years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
"ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates the year the observation
was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the observation was
recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species sampled, and
"BIOMASS" is the corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for
catchability as required).}

\item{age.table}{A table with 2 columns: "SPECIES" and "MAXAGE", the maximum
recorded age of the corresponding species.}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating which column in X to use to
calculate indicator. Default is "BIOMASS".}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. "ID", "YEAR", and "MeanLifespan".

 If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
 value is assigned NA.
}
\description{
This function calculates the mean maximum age (MMA) of fish in
 the community for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
Mean Maximum Age (MMA): \deqn{MMA = \Sigma (age_{max,i}*B_i)/\Sigma
 B_i} where the sum is over all species \eqn{i}, and \eqn{B_i} is biomass of
 species \eqn{i}. The mean lifespan or longevity is considered to be a fixed
 parameter per species. Lifespan may vary under fishing pressure, so Shin et
 al. (2010) adopted the maximum longevity observed for each species
 (\eqn{age_{max,i}}). The variation of this indicator captures changes in
 species composition.

 Recommended data: Fishery independent survey data or model output, finfish
 and squid.
