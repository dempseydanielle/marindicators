\title{Calculates the Large Fish Indicator (Greenstreet and Rogers, 2006)}
\usage{
largeFishIndicator(X_length, group, species.table = NULL,
  metric = "BIOMASS", large.fish = 35, years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_length}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
"ID", "SPECIES", "LENGTH", and "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates the year the
observation was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the
observation was recorded, and "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the
species sampled. "LENGTH" is the length class (cm) and "BIOMASS" is the
corresponding abundance at length (stratified and corrected for catchability
as required). Species for which there are no length data should be assigned
LENGTH = -99. These observations are removed by the function.}

\item{group}{A character string indicating which species to include in the
indicator calculation. If group = "ALL", all species will be included;
otherwise, group should match a column name in species.table.}

\item{species.table}{If group does not equal "ALL", species.table is a table
with at least one column, where the column name is the string group, and the
column entries are the species codes indicating the species from X to
include in the calculation. species.table may also include columns for other
species groups; these will be ignored. If group = "ALL", this table is not
required. Default is species.table = NULL.}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating which column in X to use to
calculate indicator. Default is "BIOMASS".}

\item{large.fish}{Threshold for large fish (cm). Default is 35 cm (i.e., large
fish are those with X$LENGTH >= 35 cm).}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. "ID", "YEAR", and
 "LargeFishIndicator".

 If there are no observations of large fish or no observations in X for
 spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator value is assigned NA.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Large Fish Indicator (LFI) for
 \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
Large Fish Indicator (LFI): \deqn{LFI = \Sigma B_m(L >35 cm)/\Sigma
 B_m} \eqn{B_m} is biomass of individuals in a body size class centred at
 mass m, and \eqn{L} is the length (cm) of an individual. This indicator
 describes the proportion (by weight) of the fish community that is larger
 than some length threshold (default here is 35 cm, i.e., the proportion of
 biomass occupying the top predator trophic level).

 Recommended data: Fishery independent survey data or model output; fish.
