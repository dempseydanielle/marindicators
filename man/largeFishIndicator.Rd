\title{Calculates the Large Fish Indicator}
\usage{
largeFishIndicator(X_length, group, species.table = NULL,
  metric = "BIOMASS", large.fish = 35, years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_length}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns
\code{YEAR}, \code{ID}, \code{SPECIES}, \code{LENGTH}, and \code{BIOMASS}.
\code{YEAR} indicates the year the observation was recorded, \code{ID} is an
area code indicating where the observation was recorded, and \code{SPECIES}
is a numeric code indicating the species sampled. \code{LENGTH} is the
length class (cm) and \code{BIOMASS} is the corresponding abundance at
length (stratified and corrected for catchability as required). Species for
which there are no length data should be assigned \code{LENGTH = -99}. These
observations are removed by the function.}

\item{group}{A character string indicating which species to include in the
indicator calculation. If \code{group = "ALL"}, all species will be
included; otherwise, \code{group} should match a column name in
\code{species.table}.}

\item{species.table}{A table with at least one column, where the column name
is the string \code{group}, and the column entries are species codes from
\code{X} indicating which species are included that group.
\code{species.table} may also include columns for other species groups;
these will be ignored. If \code{group = "ALL"}, this table is not required.
Default is \code{species.table = NULL}.}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating which column in \code{X} to use to
calculate indicator. Default is \code{metric = "BIOMASS"}.}

\item{large.fish}{Threshold for large fish (cm). Default is 35 cm (i.e., large
fish are those with \code{X_length$LENGTH} >= 35 cm).}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. \code{ID}, \code{YEAR}, and
 \code{LargeFishIndicator}.

 If there are no observations of large fish or no observations in \code{X}
 for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator value is assigned
 \code{NA}.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Large Fish Indicator (LFI) for
 \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
Large Fish Indicator (LFI): \deqn{LFI = \Sigma B_m(L >35 cm)/\Sigma
 B_m} \eqn{B_m} is biomass of individuals in a body size class centred at
 mass m, and \eqn{L} is the length (cm) of an individual. This indicator
 describes the proportion (by weight) of the fish community that is larger
 than some length threshold (default here is 35 cm, i.e., the proportion of
 biomass occupying the top predator trophic level; Greenstreet and Rogers,
 2006).
