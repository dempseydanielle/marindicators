\title{Calculates the mean trophic level of the community}
\usage{
meanTrophicLevelCommunity(X, TL.table, metric = c("ABUNDANCE",
  "BIOMASS"), years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
"ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS" and/or "ABUNDANCE". "ID" is an area code
designating where the observation was recorded. "SPECIES" is a numeric code
indicating the species sampled.}

\item{TL.table}{dataframe with columns "SPECIES" and the corresponding "TL"
(trophic level).}

\item{metric}{character string indicating whether to use "BIOMASS" or
"ABUNDANCE" to calculate indicator.}

\item{years}{vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. "ID", "YEAR", and
 "MeanTLCommunity"
}
\description{
This calculates the mean trophic level of the community weighted
 by biomass for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
Mean trophic level (TL): \deqn{TL = \Sigma TL_i*B_i)/\Sigma B_i}
 \eqn{TL_i} is trophic level of species \eqn{i}, and \eqn{B_i} is the biomass
 of species \eqn{i}.

 This indicator is based on trophic levels of all species with available
 biomass time series, weighted by annual species-specific biomass, to reflect
 the structure of the community.

 Recommended data: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates.
