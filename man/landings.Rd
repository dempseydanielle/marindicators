\title{Calculates the landings per fished group}
\usage{
landings(land, group, species.table = NULL, years)
}
\arguments{
\item{land}{A dataframe of commercial landings data with columns "YEAR", "ID",
"SPECIES" and "CATCH". "YEAR" indicates the year the landing
was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the landing was
recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species landed, and
"CATCH" is the corresponding landed weight.}

\item{group}{A character string indicating which species to include in the
indicator calculation. If group = "ALL", all species will be included;
otherwise, group should match a column name in species.table.}

\item{species.table}{A table with default species.table = NULL. If group =
"ALL", this table is not required. If group does not equal "ALL",
species.table is a table with at least one column, where the column name is
the same as group, and the column  entries are the species codes indicating
the species to be included in the calculation. species.table may also
include columns for different species groups; these will be ignored.}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
returns a dataframe with three columns: "ID", "YEAR", and
 "group_Landings".

 If there is no data for a given year, the indicator value is set to 0.
}
\description{
This function calculates the the catch of predefined speceies
 groups from commercial fisheries that is landed ashore for \eqn{j} areas and
 \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
Calculates the total landings of predefined species groups.

 Recommended data: commercial fisheries landings
