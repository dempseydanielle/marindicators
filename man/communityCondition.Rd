\title{Calculates Fulton's Condition Index for the community}
\usage{
communityCondition(X_length, groups, species.table = NULL, LenWt.table,
  years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_length}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data or model
output with columns \code{YEAR}, \code{ID}, \code{SPECIES}, \code{LENGTH},
and \code{ABUNDANCE}. \code{YEAR} indicates the year the observation was
recorded, \code{ID} is an area code indicating where the observation was
recorded, and \code{SPECIES} is a numeric code indicating the species
sampled. \code{LENGTH} is the length class (cm) and \code{ABUNDANCE} is the
corresponding abundance at length (stratified and corrected for
catchability as required). Species for which there are no length data
should be assigned \code{LENGTH = -99}. These observations are removed by
the function.}

\item{groups}{A vector indicating the species group(s) for which to calculate
the indicator. Each entry must be a character string matching the name of a
column in \code{species.groups}.}

\item{species.table}{If \code{group} does not equal \code{"ALL"},
\code{species.table} is a table with at least one column, where the column
name is the string \code{group}, and the column entries are the species
codes indicating the species from \code{X} to include in the calculation.
\code{species.table} may also include columns for other species groups;
these will be ignored. If \code{group = "ALL"}, this table is not required.
Default is \code{species.table = NULL}.}

\item{LenWt.table}{A table of annual length at weight data with 5 columns.
\code{YEAR}, \code{ID}, \code{SPECIES} correspond with those columns in
\code{X_length}. \code{LENGTH} is fish length at the corresponding
\code{WEIGHT} (fish weight).}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with columns \code{ID} and \code{YEAR}, and a
  column \code{CCondition_group} for each entry in \code{groups}.

  If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
  value is assigned \code{NA}.
}
\description{
This function calculates Fulton's condition index for \eqn{j}
  areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
Fulton's Condition Index (\eqn{K}): \deqn{K = \Sigma(K_j *
  A_j)/\Sigma A_j} where the sum is over all species, \eqn{j}, \eqn{A_j} is
  the abundance of species \eqn{j}, and \deqn{K_j = 100*W_j/L_j^3} where
  \eqn{W_j} is the mean weight at length \eqn{L} for species \eqn{j} (Ricker,
  1975).
