\title{Calculates all resource potential indicators}
\usage{
allPotential(X, land, species.table, speciesinfo.table, resource.groups,
  cutoff = 0, TE = 0.1, base.start, base.end, years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
"ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates the year the observation
was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the observation was
recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species sampled, and
"BIOMASS" is the corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for
catchability as required).}

\item{land}{A dataframe of commercial landings data with columns "YEAR", "ID",
"SPECIES" and "CATCH". "YEAR" indicates the year the landing was recorded,
"ID" is an area code indicating where the landing was recorded, "SPECIES" is
a numeric code indicating the species landed, and "CATCH" is the
corresponding landed weight.}

\item{species.table}{A table where the column names match the entries in
resource.groups. Column entries are the species codes indicating the species
from X included in each group. species.table may also include columns for
other species groups; these will be ignored.}

\item{speciesinfo.table}{A table with columns "SPECIES" and the corresponding
"TL_LAND" (trophic level of landed species). Entries in the "SPECIES" column
should be the unique values of species codes in land (or a subset thereof).
Other columns will be ignored.}

\item{resource.groups}{A vector indicating the species groups for which to
calculate the resource potential. Each entry must be a character string
matching the name of a column in species.groups. If resource.groups = NULL,
the resource potential indicators will not be calculated.}

\item{cutoff}{The minimum trophic level of species to include to calculate
FiB. If cutoff = NULL, FiB wll not be calculated.}

\item{TE}{Trophic efficiency, used to calculate FiB. Default is TE = 0.1,
i.e., a trophic efficiency of 10\%. If TE = NULL, FiB wll not be calculated.}

\item{base.start}{Year indicating the beginning of the baseline period for
calculating FiB. The average landings and average mean trophic level of the
landings over the baseline period are used as baseline values to calculate
FiB (see Details). land must include data for the baseline period. If
base.start = NULL, FiB wll not be calculated.}

\item{base.end}{Year indicating the end of the baseline period for calculating
FiB. The average landings and average mean trophic level of the landings
over the baseline period are used as baseline values to calculate FiB (see
Details). land must include data for the baseline period. If base.end =
NULL, FiB wll not be calculated.}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicators.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with columns "ID", "YEAR", and indicators
 corresponding to the arguments supplied to the function.
}
\description{
This function calculates all (or a subset) of the resource
 potential indicators for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
This function calculates the resource potential indicators: abundance
 and biomass of the community, resource potential of predefined species
 groups, and fishing-in-balance (FiB). If data are not available to calculate
 one or more of these indicators, a subset will be returned. See the help
 file for the individual functions for information on how each indicator is
 calculated.
