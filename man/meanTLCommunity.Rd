\title{Calculates the Mean Trophic Level of the community}
\usage{
meanTLCommunity(X, TL.table, metric = "BIOMASS", years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A dataframe of fishery independent data derived from research vessel
survey data or model output, with columns \code{YEAR}, \code{ID},
\code{SPECIES}, and \code{BIOMASS}. \code{YEAR} indicates the year the
observation was recorded, \code{ID} is an area code indicating where the
observation was recorded, \code{SPECIES} is a numeric code indicating the
species sampled, and \code{BIOMASS} is the corresponding biomass (stratified
and corrected for catchability as required).}

\item{TL.table}{A dataframe with columns \code{SPECIES} and the corresponding
\code{TL} (trophic level). Entries in the \code{SPECIES} column should be
the unique values of species codes in \code{X} (or a subset thereof). Other
columns in \code{TL.table} are ignored.}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating which column in \code{X} to use to
calculate indicator. Default is \code{metric = "BIOMASS"}.}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. \code{ID}, \code{YEAR}, and
 \code{MeanTLCommunity}.

 If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
 value is assigned \code{NA}.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Mean Trophic Level of the community
 weighted by biomass for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
Mean trophic level (TL): \deqn{TL = \Sigma (TL_i*B_i)/\Sigma B_i}
 \eqn{TL_i} is trophic level of species \eqn{i}, and \eqn{B_i} is the biomass
 of species \eqn{i}.

 This indicator is based on trophic levels of all species with available
 biomass time series, weighted by annual species-specific biomass, to reflect
 the structure of the community (Christensen, 1998).
}

# Compile data
data(X)

# Calculate indicator
