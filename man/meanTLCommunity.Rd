\title{Calculates the mean trophic level of the community (Christensen, 1998)}
\usage{
meanTLCommunity(X, TL.table, metric = "BIOMASS", years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
"ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates the year the observation
was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the observation was
recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species sampled, and
"BIOMASS" is the corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for
catchability as required).}

\item{TL.table}{A dataframe with columns "SPECIES" and the corresponding "TL"
(trophic level).}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating which column in X to use to
calculate indicator. Default is "BIOMASS".}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. "ID", "YEAR", and
 "MeanTLCommunity".

 If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
 value is assigned NA.
}
\description{
This function calculates the mean trophic level of the community
 weighted by biomass for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
Mean trophic level (TL): \deqn{TL = \Sigma TL_i*B_i)/\Sigma B_i}
 \eqn{TL_i} is trophic level of species \eqn{i}, and \eqn{B_i} is the biomass
 of species \eqn{i}.

 This indicator is based on trophic levels of all species with available
 biomass time series, weighted by annual species-specific biomass, to reflect
 the structure of the community.

 Recommended data: Fishery independent survey data or model output; fish and
 invertebrates.
