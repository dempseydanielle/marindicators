\title{Calculates Pielou's Species Evenness}
\usage{
pielouSpeciesEvenness(X, group = c("FINFISH", "ALL"),
  metric = c("BIOMASS", "ABUNDANCE"), years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
"ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS" and/or "ABUNDANCE". "ID" is an area code
designating where the observation was recorded (a string). "SPECIES" is a
numeric code indicating the species sampled.}

\item{group}{character string indicating which species to include, either
"ALL" or "FINFISH". Note that this subsetting is based on the Fisheries and
Oceans Canada species codes for the Scotian Shelf. For other regions it may
be prudent to subsetdata to species groups of interest prior to using the
function and then choose group = "ALL". Type ?speciesgroups for more
information.}

\item{metric}{character string indicating whether to use "BIOMASS" or
"ABUNDANCE" to calculate the indicator.}

\item{years}{vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with 3 columns: "ID", YEAR", and "PielouEvenness"
}
\description{
This function takes a dataframe of fisheries independent survey
 data and calculates Pielou's Species Evenness for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i}
 years.
}
\details{
Pielou's Species Evenness: \deqn{J' = -\Sigma p_i ln( p_i )/ln(S)}
 \eqn{p_i} is the proportion of the total sample contributed by the i(th)
 species and \eqn{S} is the number of species recorded in the sample.
 Pielou's index is the Shannon-Weiner index computed for the sample \eqn{S}
 and represents a measure of evenness of the community.

 **Recommended data: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates.
