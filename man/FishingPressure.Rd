\title{Calculates fishing pressure}
\usage{
FishingPressure(X, land, group, years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
"ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "ID" is an area code designating where the
observation was recorded (a string). "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating
the species sampled.}

\item{land}{dataframe of commercial landings data with columns "YEAR", "ID",
"ALLCODES" and "CATCH". "ID" is an area code designating where the
observation was recorded. "ALLCODES" is a numeric commercial species code
indicating the species landed, and "CATCH" is the corresponding landed
weight. Additional columns are required for each species group of interest.
These columns have value of "1" in the rows of species included in the group
and "NA" in all other rows.}

\item{group}{string indicating the species group for which to calculate the
landings. Should match one of the column names of land. If group = "ALL" the
fishing pressure on the whole community will be calculated.}

\item{years}{vector of years for which to calculate indicator}
}
\value{
returns a dataframe with three columns: "ID", "YEAR", and "FP_group".

 If biomass of group is NA and landings of group are zero, fishing pressure
 is set to zero. Otherwise, if biomass of group is NA, fishing pressure is
 set to NA.

\description{
This function calculates fishing pressure on a fished group for
 \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
Fishing pressure (FP): \deqn{FP = Y_{FG}/B_{FG}} where \eqn{B_{FG}}
 is the biomass of the fished group(s) and \eqn{Y_{FG}} is the landed catch
 of the group(s).

 This indicator measures the level of exploitation or total fishing pressure
 at the ecosystem level. Change in this indicator can result from change in
 \eqn{B_{FG}}, \eqn{Y_{FG}} or both. If \eqn{B_{FG}} and \eqn{Y_{FG}} change
 in the same direction, exploitation rate may not change.

 Recommended data: \eqn{B_{FG}}: fishery independent surveys, \eqn{Y_{FG}}:
 commercial fisheries landings
