\title{Calculates fishing pressure}
\usage{
fishingPressure(X, land, FP.groups, species.table = NULL, years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
"ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates the year the observation
was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the observation was
recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species sampled, and
"BIOMASS" is the corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for
catchability as required).}

\item{land}{A dataframe of commercial landings data with columns "YEAR", "ID",
"SPECIES" and "CATCH". "YEAR" indicates the year the landing was recorded,
"ID" is an area code indicating where the landing was recorded, "SPECIES" is
a numeric code indicating the species landed, and "CATCH" is the
corresponding landed weight.}

\item{FP.groups}{A dataframe with two columns, which must be named
"group.land" and "group.X". Each row holds the group names to calculate the
fishing pressure on a target group, with the numerator in column
"group.land" and the denominator in column "group.X".  Each entry must be a
character string matching the name of a column in species.groups.}

\item{species.table}{A table with column names that match the entries of
FP.groups. The entries in each column are the species codes for the species
included in that group. Species codes should be a subset of those in the
"SPECIES" column of land (for group.land) or X (for group.X). species.table
may also include columns for other species groups; these will be ignored.
Note that an entry in FP.groups could be "ALL". In this case, a column in
species.table named "ALL" is not required; the function will automatically
include all species in land and/or X.}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with three columns: "ID", "YEAR", and a column for
 each target group, named "FP_group.X".

 If biomass of group is NA and landings of group are zero, fishing pressure
 is set to zero. Otherwise, if biomass of group is NA, fishing pressure is
 set to NA.
}
\description{
This function calculates fishing pressure on a fished group for
 \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
Fishing pressure (FP): \deqn{FP = Y_{FG}/B_{FG}} where \eqn{B_{FG}}
 is the biomass of the fished group(s) and \eqn{Y_{FG}} is the landed catch
 of the group(s).

 This indicator measures the level of exploitation or total fishing pressure
 at the ecosystem level. Change in this indicator can result from change in
 \eqn{B_{FG}}, \eqn{Y_{FG}} or both. If \eqn{B_{FG}} and \eqn{Y_{FG}} change
 in the same direction, exploitation rate may not change.

 Recommended data: \eqn{B_{FG}}: fishery independent survey data,
 \eqn{Y_{FG}}: commercial fisheries landings
