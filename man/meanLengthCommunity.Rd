\title{Calculates the Mean Length of the Community weighted by biomass or
 abundance}
\usage{
meanLengthCommunity(X_length, metric, years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_length}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns
\code{YEAR}, \code{ID}, \code{SPECIES}, \code{LENGTH}, and \code{BIOMASS}.
\code{YEAR} indicates the year the observation was recorded, \code{ID} is an
area code indicating where the observation was recorded, and \code{SPECIES}
is a numeric code indicating the species sampled. \code{LENGTH} is the
length class (cm) and \code{BIOMASS} is the corresponding abundance at
length (stratified and corrected for catchability as required). Species for
which there are no length data should be assigned \code{LENGTH = -99}. These
observations are removed by the function.}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating which column in \code{X} to use to
calculate indicator.}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. \code{ID}, \code{YEAR}, and
 \code{MeanLength_metric}.

 If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
 value is assigned \code{NA}.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Mean Length of the Community
 weighted by biomass or abundance for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
\deqn{MeanLength = \Sigma(Length_m * metric_i)/\Sigma metric_j} where
 \eqn{Length_m} is the length (cm) of an individual in size class \eqn{m},
 \eqn{metric_i} is the biomass or abundance of species \eqn{i} and
 \eqn{metric_j} is the total biomass or abundance of the community (Shin et
 al., 2010).

\examples{
data(X_length)
meanLengthCommunity(X_length, metric = "BIOMASS", years = c(2014:2019))
meanLengthCommunity(X_length, metric = "BIOMASS", years = c(2014:2019))
