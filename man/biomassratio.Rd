\title{Calculates the biomass ratio between two species groups}
\usage{
biomassRatio(X, ratio.groups, species.table, metric = "BIOMASS", years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data or model output with
columns \code{YEAR}, \code{ID}, \code{SPECIES}, and \code{BIOMASS}.
\code{YEAR} indicates the year the observation was recorded, \code{ID} is an
area code indicating where the observation was recorded, \code{SPECIES} is a
numeric code indicating the species sampled, and \code{BIOMASS} is the
corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for catchability as
required).}

\item{ratio.groups}{A dataframe with two columns, which must be named
\code{group1} and \code{group2}. Each row holds the group names for one
biomass ratio, with the numerator in column \code{group1} and the
denominator in column \code{group2}. Each entry must be a character string
matching the name of a column in \code{species.table} or \code{"ALL"}.}

\item{species.table}{A table with column names that match the entries of
\code{ratio.groups}. The entries in each column are the species codes from
\code{X} indicating which species are included that group.
\code{species.table} may also include columns for other species groups;
these will be ignored. Note that an entry in \code{ratio.groups} could be
\code{"ALL"}. In this case, a column in \code{species.table} named
\code{"ALL"} is not required; the function will automatically include all
species in \code{X}.}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating which column in \code{X} to use to
calculate indicator. Default is \code{metric = "BIOMASS"}.}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with columns \code{ID} and \code{YEAR}, and a
 column for each biomass ratio, named after the entries in ratio.groups, e.g.
 \code{group1_group2}.

 If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
 values is assigned \code{NA}.
}
\description{
This function calculates the biomass ratio between two
 pre-defined species groups for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
One useful biomass ratio is the proportion of predatory fish in the
 community, which is estimated by:

 PropPred = Biomass of Predatory Fish Surveyed/Total Biomass Surveyed

 Predatory fish species are defined as all surveyed fish species that are not
 largely planktivorous, ie., fish that are piscivorous, or that feed on
 invertebrates larger than the macrozooplankton category (0.2 cm; Shin et al.
 2010). Phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus feeders should be excluded.
 This indicator captures changes in the trophic structure and changes in the
 functional diversity of fish in the ecosystem.

 Other useful biomass \eqn{(B)} ratios indicators include:
 \deqn{B_{invertebrates}/B_{demersal}} and \deqn{B_{pelagic}/B_{demersal}}
