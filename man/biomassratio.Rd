\title{Calculates the biomass ratio between two species groups}
\usage{
biomassRatio(X, group1, group2, species.table, metric = "BIOMASS", years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
"ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates the year the observation
was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the observation was
recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species sampled, and
"BIOMASS" is the corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for
catchability as required).}

\item{group1}{A character string indicating which species to include in the
numerator. Must match the name of a column in species.table.}

\item{group2}{A character string indicating which species to include in the
denominator. Must be "ALL" or match the name of a column in species.table.}

\item{species.table}{A table with at least one column, named after the string
group1. The entries in column group1 are the species codes for the species
included in this group. If group2 is not "ALL", an additional column in
species.table is required. This column is named after the string group2, and
entries are the species codes for the species included in this group.
species.table may also include columns for other species groups; these will
be ignored.}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating which column in X to use to
calculate indicator. Default is "BIOMASS".}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. "ID", "YEAR", and "group1_group2".

 If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
 values is assigned NA.
}
\description{
This function calculates the biomass ratio between two
 pre-defined species groups for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
One useful biomass ratio is the proportion of predatory fish in the
 community, which is estimated by: \deqn{PropPred = Biomass Predatory Fish
 Surveyed/Total Biomass Surveyed} Predatory fish species are defined as all
 surveyed fish species that are not largely planktivorous (i.e. phytoplankton
 and zooplankton feeders should be excluded; Shin et al. 2010). A fish
 species is classified as predatory if it is piscivorous, or if it feeds on
 invertebrates that are larger than the macrozooplankton category (0.2 cm).
 Detritivores should not be classified as predatory fish. This indicator
 captures changes in the trophic structure and changes in the functional
 diversity of fish in the ecosystem.

 Other useful biomass \eqn{(B)} ratios indicators include:
 \deqn{B_{invertebrates}/B_{demersal}} and \deqn{B_{pelagic}/B_{demersal}}

 Recommended data: Fishery independent survey data or model output; fish and
 invertebrates.
