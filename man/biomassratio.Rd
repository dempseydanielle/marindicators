\title{Calculates the biomass ratio between two species groups}
\usage{
biomassRatio(X, ratio.groups, species.table, metric = "BIOMASS", years)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
"ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates the year the observation
was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the observation was
recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species sampled, and
"BIOMASS" is the corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for
catchability as required).}

\item{ratio.groups}{A dataframe with two columns, which must be named "group1"
and "group2". Each row holds the group names for one biomass ratio, with the
numerator in column "group1" and the denominator in column "group2".  Each
entry must be a character string matching the name of a column in
species.groups.}

\item{species.table}{A table with column names that match the entries of
ratio.groups. The entries in each column are the species codes for the
species included in that group. Species codes should be a subset of those in
the "SPECIES" column of X. species.table may also include columns for other
species groups; these will be ignored. Note that an entry in ratio.groups
could be "ALL". In this case, a column in species.table named "ALL" is not
required; the function will automatically include all species in X.}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating which column in X to use to
calculate indicator. Default is "BIOMASS".}

\item{years}{A vector of years for which to calculate indicator.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with columns "ID" and "YEAR", and a column for
 each biomass ratio, named after the entries in ratio.groups, e.g.
 "group1_group2".

 If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
 values is assigned NA.
}
\description{
This function calculates the biomass ratio between two
 pre-defined species groups for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
}
\details{
One useful biomass ratio is the proportion of predatory fish in the
 community, which is estimated by: \deqn{PropPred = Biomass Predatory Fish
 Surveyed/Total Biomass Surveyed} Predatory fish species are defined as all
 surveyed fish species that are not largely planktivorous, ie., fish that are
 piscivorous, or that feed on invertebrates larger than the macrozooplankton
 category (0.2 cm; Shin et al. 2010). Phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus
 feeders should be excluded. This indicator captures changes in the trophic
 structure and changes in the functional diversity of fish in the ecosystem.

 Other useful biomass \eqn{(B)} ratios indicators include:
 \deqn{B_{invertebrates}/B_{demersal}} and \deqn{B_{pelagic}/B_{demersal}}

 Recommended data: Fishery independent survey data or model output; fish and
 invertebrates.
