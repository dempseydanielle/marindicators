  Marine Ecosystem Indicators Package
}

\description{ The \pkg{indicators} package provides functions to calculate indicators for 4 marine ecosystem attributes and 1 marine ecosystem pressure from fisheries independent trawl survey data and fisheries landings data.
 }

\details{ A comprehensive evaluation and selection of robust ecological indicators is one of the key steps in the process of implementing an Ecosystem Approach to fisheries management and to track progress towards meeting ecosystem goals. The "Guidance framework for the selection and evaluation of ecological indicators" (Bundy, Gomez, and Cook, 2017) developed an Indicator Selection Guidance Framework to select and evaluate potential indicators for ecosystem monitoring and assessment at different spatial scales using established selection criteria. Over 100 indicators were initially selected to represent the ecosystem attributes and pressure defined in Step 1 of the framework: Biodiversity, Ecosystem Structure and Functioning, Ecosystem Stability and Resistance to Perturbations, Resource Potential, and Fishing Pressure. The framework was successfully tested for the Scotian Shelf Bioregion, resulting in a final suite of 30 non-redundant ecological and fishing pressure indicators derived from fisheries independent and dependent data.

The \pkg{indicators} package provides functions to calculate the full suite of marine ecosystem indicators screened in Step 4 of the guidance framework (Table 1; Bundy, Gomez, and Cook, 2017). Each indicator provides information on an ecosystem attribute or pressure. For more information, including attribute definitions and related sub-attributes, please refer to the guidance framework document (Bundy, Gomez, and Cook, 2017).

The data required to apply the \pkg{indicators} package depends on the indicator(s) to be calculated. In general, indicators related to ecosystem attibutes require annual fishery-independent survey data, while indicators related to ecosystem pressures require annual commercial landings data. Additional information on the species recorded is required to calculate some indicators, including: trophic level, intrinsic vulnerability index, maximum recorded age, maximum recorded length, and annual length-at-weight data. See the help page for a specific function to determine its data requirements.
