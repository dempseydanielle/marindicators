\description{
This function takes a dataframe with columns **** and calculates
  the inverse of the coefficient of variation of the biomass
  (InverseCVBiomass)
}
\details{
The inverse of the coefficient of variation of the biomass
  (InverseCVBiomass) was estimated as a five year moving average:
  \deqn{InverseCVBiomass = 1/(1/n)\Sigma(SD_i/Xbar_i)} The sum is from year
  \eqn{i} to year \eqn{i+n-1}, where \eqn{n=5} for the 5-year moving average.
  \eqn{SD_i} is the standard deviation of the mean biomass and \eqn{X_i} is the mean
  biomass for year i.

  Data used: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates
