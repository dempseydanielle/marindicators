## Comments

* This is a re-submission.
* We have addressed the issues noted by the CRAN reviewer
1. We removed the redundant part "Calculates"" from the title.
2. We revised the Description so it does not begin with "The marindicators package".
3. We added an ISBN to the reference in the Description.

## Test environments
* checked on all recommended platforms using rhub::check_for_cran()
- R-hub windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel)
- R-hub ubuntu-gcc-release (r-release)
- R-hub fedora-clang-devel (r-devel)

## R CMD check results (from R-hub)
There were 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 2 notes returned from the R-hub R CMD check.
The notes are both related to possibly mis-spelled words in the DESCRIPTION. We have verified that these words are spelled correctly.

This is a re-submission.
