Welcome to the indicators package. It is awesome.


NOTES on the Example folder:

Please remove folder "Example" from indicators before installing the package.

"Example" includes two scripts: 

calc_indicators.R shows how to use each function to calculate all indicators from Tech Report for ESS and WSS

calc_indicators_test.R calculates each indicator and compares the values to the output from Adam's code
using the "all.equal()" function.

The data required to run these scripts is on the shared drive: 
"R:\Science\Population Ecology Division\Shared\!PED_Staff\DempseyD\indicators_data"
