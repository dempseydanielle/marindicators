Welcome to the indicators package. It is awesome.

NOTES on the Example folder:
Please remove folder "Example" from indicators before installing the package.
Save "Example" somewhere special and write the file path in scripts Example/calc_indicators.R (line 5)
and Example/calc_indicators_test.R (line 8)

"Example" includes two scripts plus folders that contain all the data needed to calculate the indicators.

calc_indicators.R shows how to use each function to calculate all indicators from Tech Report for ESS and WSS

calc_indicators_test.R calculates each indicator and compares the values to the output from Adam's code
using the "all.equal()" function.
