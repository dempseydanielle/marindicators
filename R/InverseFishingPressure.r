#'@title Calculates inverse fishing pressure
#'@description This function calculates the inverse fishing pressure on a fished
#'  group for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.(***not in Table S4)
#'@details Fishing pressure (InverseFP): \deqn{FP = B_{FG}/Y_{FG}} where
#'  \eqn{B_{FG}} is the biomass of the fished group(s) and \eqn{Y_{FG}} is the
#'  landed catch of the group(s).
#'
#'  Recommended data: \eqn{B_{FG}}: fishery independent surveys, \eqn{Y_{FG}}:
#'  commercial fisheries landings
#'@param X dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
#'  "ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "ID" is an area code designating where the
#'  observation was recorded (a string). "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating
#'  the species sampled.
#'@param land dataframe of commercial landings data with columns "YEAR", "ID",
#'  "ALLCODES" and "CATCH". "ID" is an area code designating where the
#'  observation was recorded. "ALLCODES" is a numeric commercial species code
#'  indicating the species landed, and "CATCH" is the corresponding landed
#'  weight. Additional columns are required for each species group of interest.
#'  These columns have value of "1" in the rows of species included in the group
#'  and "NA" in all other rows.
#'@param group string indicating the species group for which to calculate the
#'  landings. Should match one of the column names of land. If group = "ALL" the
#'  fishing pressure on the whole community will be calculated.
#'@param years vector of years for which to calculate indicator
#'@return returns a dataframe with three columns: "ID", "YEAR", and
#'  "invFP_group"
