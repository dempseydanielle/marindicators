#'@title Calculates the mean trophic level of the community
#'@description This calculates the mean trophic level of the community weighted
#'  by biomass for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
#'@details Mean trophic level (TL): \deqn{TL = \Sigma TL_i*B_i)/\Sigma B_i}
#'  \eqn{TL_i} is trophic level of species \eqn{i}, and \eqn{B_i} is the biomass
#'  of species \eqn{i}.
#'
#'  This indicator is based on trophic levels of all species with available
#'  biomass time series, weighted by annual species-specific biomass, to reflect
#'  the structure of the community.
#'
#'  Recommended data: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates.
#'@param X dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
#'  "ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS" and/or "ABUNDANCE". "ID" is an area code
#'  designating where the observation was recorded. "SPECIES" is a numeric code
#'  indicating the species sampled.
#'
#'  This function can also calculate the mean trophic level of the community
#'  from length-based data. To do so, X should be a dataframe with seven
#'  columns: "YEAR", "ID", and "SPECIES", are as above. "FLEN" indicates the
#'  size class, and "GROUP_NAME" and "TL" are the corresponding size-based
#'  functional group and trophic level, respectively. "BIOMASS" is the recorded
#'  biomass of the size-based functional groups. Note that one SPECIES code may
#'  be assigned more than one GROUP_NAME if ontogentic shifts occur. For
#'  example, on the Scotian Shelf small (< 33 cm) and large (>33 cm) haddock
#'  both have SPECIES code 11. Small haddock are assigend to GROUP_NAME
#'  "Haddock<33" with trophic level 3.38. Large haddock are assigned to
#'  GROUP_NAME "Haddock33+" with trophic level 3.43.
#'
#'@param TL.table dataframe with columns "SPECIES" and the corresponding "TL"
#'  (trophic level). Set to "NULL" if length.based = TRUE.
#'@param metric character string indicating whether to use "BIOMASS" or
#'  "ABUNDANCE" to calculate indicator.
#'@param years vector of years for which to calculate indicator.
#'@param length.based logical variable. length.based = TRUE indicates that X is
#'  length-based data. Default is length.based = FALSE
#'@return Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. "ID", "YEAR", and
#'  "MeanTLCommunity" (if length.based = FALSE) or "MeanTLCommunity_Length" if
#'  length.based = TRUE
