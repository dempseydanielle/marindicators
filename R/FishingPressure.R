#'@title Calculates fishing pressure
#'@description This function calculates fishing pressure on a fished group for
#'  \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
#'@details Fishing pressure (FP): \deqn{FP = Y_{FG}/B_{FG}} where \eqn{B_{FG}}
#'  is the biomass of the fished group(s) and \eqn{Y_{FG}} is the landed catch
#'  of the group(s).
#'
#'  This indicator measures the level of exploitation or total fishing pressure
#'  at the ecosystem level. Change in this indicator can result from change in
#'  \eqn{B_{FG}}, \eqn{Y_{FG}} or both. If \eqn{B_{FG}} and \eqn{Y_{FG}} change
#'  in the same direction, exploitation rate may not change.
#'
#'  Recommended data: \eqn{B_{FG}}: fishery independent survey data,
#'  \eqn{Y_{FG}}: commercial fisheries landings

#'@param FP.groups A dataframe with two columns, which must be named
#'  "group.land" and "group.X". Each row holds the group names to calculate the
#'  fishing pressure on a target group, with the numerator in column
#'  "group.land" and the denominator in column "group.X".  Each entry must be a
#'  character string matching the name of a column in species.groups.
#'@param species.table A table with column names that match the entries of
#'  FP.groups. The entries in each column are the species codes for the species
#'  included in that group. Species codes should be a subset of those in the
#'  "SPECIES" column of land (for group.land) or X (for group.X). species.table
#'  may also include columns for other species groups; these will be ignored.
#'  Note that an entry in FP.groups could be "ALL". In this case, a column in
#'  species.table named "ALL" is not required; the function will automatically
#'  include all species in land and/or X.
#'@return Returns a dataframe with three columns: "ID", "YEAR", and a column for
#'  each target group, named "FP_group.X".
#'
#'  If biomass of group is NA and landings of group are zero, fishing pressure
#'  is set to zero. Otherwise, if biomass of group is NA, fishing pressure is
#'  set to NA.
