#'@title Calculates fishing pressure
#'@description This function calculates fishing pressure on a fished group for
#'  \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
#'@details Fishing pressure (FP): \deqn{FP = Y_{FG}/B_{FG}} where \eqn{B_{FG}}
#'  is the biomass of the fished group(s) and \eqn{Y_{FG}} is the landed catch
#'  of the group(s).
#'
#'  This indicator measures the level of exploitation or total fishing pressure
#'  at the ecosystem level. Change in this indicator can result from change in
#'  \eqn{B_{FG}}, \eqn{Y_{FG}} or both. If \eqn{B_{FG}} and \eqn{Y_{FG}} change
#'  in the same direction, exploitation rate may not change.
#'
#'  Recommended data: \eqn{B_{FG}}: fishery independent survey data,
#'  \eqn{Y_{FG}}: commercial fisheries landings
#'@inheritParams landings
#'@param X A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
#'  "ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates the year the observation
#'  was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the observation was
#'  recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species sampled, and
#'  "BIOMASS" is the corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for
#'  catchability as required).
#'@param group.X A character string indicating which species to include in the
#'  denominator. Must match the name of a column in species.table.
#'@param group.land A character string indicating which species to include in
#'  the numerator. Must match the name of a column in species.table.
#'@param species.table A table with at least two columns, named after the
#'  strings in group.X and group.land. The entries in column group.X are all the
#'  species in the fished group. The entries in column group.land are the
#'  species of interest landed from this group. species.table may also include
#'  columns for other species groups; these will be ignored. If group.X and
#'  group.land both equal "ALL", fishing pressure on the whole community is
#'  calculated, and species.table can be NULL.
#'@return Returns a dataframe with three columns: "ID", "YEAR", and "FP_group".
#'
#'  If biomass of group is NA and landings of group are zero, fishing pressure
#'  is set to zero. Otherwise, if biomass of group is NA, fishing pressure is
#'  set to NA.
