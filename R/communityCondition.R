#' @title Calculates Fulton's Condition Index for the community (Ricker, 1975)
#' @description This function calculates Fulton's condition index for \eqn{j}
#'   areas and \eqn{i} years.
#' @details Fulton's Condition Index (\eqn{K}): \deqn{K = \Sigma(K_j *
#'   A_j)/\Sigma A_j} where the sum is over all species, \eqn{j}, \eqn{A_j} is
#'   the abundance of species \eqn{j}, and \deqn{K_j = 100*W_j/L_j^3} where
#'   \eqn{W_j} is the mean weight at length \eqn{L} for species \eqn{j}.
#'
#'   Recommended data: Fishery independent survey data or model output; fish.
#' @inheritParams resourcePotential
#' @param X A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
#'   "ID", "SPECIES", "LENGTH", and "ABUNDANCE". "YEAR" indicates the year the
#'   observation was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the
#'   observation was recorded, and "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the
#'   species sampled. "LENGTH" is the length class (cm) and "ABUNDANCE" is the
#'   corresponding abundance at length (stratified and corrected for
#'   catchability as required). Species for which there are no length data
#'   should be assigned LENGTH = -99. These observations are removed by the
#'   function.
#' @param LenWt.table A table of annual length at weight data with 5 columns.
#'   "YEAR", "ID", "SPECIES" correspond with those columns in X. "LENGTH" is
#'   fish length at the corresponding "WEIGHT" (fish weight).
#' @return Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. "ID", "YEAR", and
#'   "CommunityCondition_group".
#'
#'   If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
#'   value is assigned NA.
