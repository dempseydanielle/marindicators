#' @title Calculates Hill's index of diversity
#' @description This function takes a dataframe with columns **** and calculates
#'   Hill's diversity index.
#' @details Hill's N1 diversity index is the exponential of the Shannon-Weiner
#'   index.\deqn{HillN1 = e^{-\Sigma p_i ln( p_i )}} \eqn{p_i} is the proportion
#'   of the total sample contributed by the i(th) species and \eqn{S} is the
#'   number of species recorded in the sample. This index is sensitive to the
#'   number of species recorded in the sample.
#'
#'   **Recommended data: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates.
#'
#' @param X is probably a dataframe with certain columns.
#' @param group is where you select which groups to include
#' @param metric is where you choose if you want to calculate using biomass or
#'   abundance
