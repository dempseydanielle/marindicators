#'@title Calculates the biomass ratio between two species groups
#'@description This function calculates the biomass ratio between two
#'  pre-defined species groups for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
#'@details One useful biomass ratio is the proportion of predatory fish in the
#'  community, which is estimated by: \deqn{PropPred = Biomass Predatory Fish
#'  Surveyed/Total Biomass Surveyed} Predatory fish species are defined as all
#'  surveyed fish species that are not largely planktivorous, ie., fish that are
#'  piscivorous, or that feed on invertebrates larger than the macrozooplankton
#'  category (0.2 cm; Shin et al. 2010). Phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus
#'  feeders should be excluded. This indicator captures changes in the trophic
#'  structure and changes in the functional diversity of fish in the ecosystem.
#'
#'  Other useful biomass \eqn{(B)} ratios indicators include:
#'  \deqn{B_{invertebrates}/B_{demersal}} and \deqn{B_{pelagic}/B_{demersal}}
#'
#'  Recommended data: Fishery independent survey data or model output; fish and
#'  invertebrates.
#'@inheritParams resourcePotential
#'@param X A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
#'  "ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates the year the observation
#'  was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the observation was
#'  recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species sampled, and
#'  "BIOMASS" is the corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for
#'  catchability as required).
#'@param ratio.groups A dataframe with two columns, which must be named "group1"
#'  and "group2". Each row holds the group names for one biomass ratio, with the
#'  numerator in column "group1" and the denominator in column "group2".  Each
#'  entry must be a character string matching the name of a column in
#'  species.groups.
#'@param species.table A table with column names that match the entries of
#'  ratio.groups. The entries in each column are the species codes for the
#'  species included in that group. Species codes should be a subset of those in
#'  the "SPECIES" column of X. species.table may also include columns for other
#'  species groups; these will be ignored. Note that an entry in ratio.groups
#'  could be "ALL". In this case, a column in species.table named "ALL" is not
#'  required; the function will automatically include all species in X.
#'@return Returns a dataframe with columns "ID" and "YEAR", and a column for
#'  each biomass ratio, named after the entries in ratio.groups, e.g.
#'  "group1_group2".
#'
#'  If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
#'  values is assigned NA.
