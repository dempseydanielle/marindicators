#'@title Calculates the biomass ratio between two species groups
#'@description This function calculates the biomass ratio between two
#'  pre-defined species groups for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
#'@details One useful biomass ratio is the proportion of predatory fish in the
#'  community, which is estimated by:
#'
#'  PropPred = Biomass of Predatory Fish Surveyed/Total Biomass Surveyed
#'
#'  Predatory fish species are defined as all surveyed fish species that are not
#'  largely planktivorous, ie., fish that are piscivorous, or that feed on
#'  invertebrates larger than the macrozooplankton category (0.2 cm; Shin et al.
#'  2010). Phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus feeders should be excluded.
#'  This indicator captures changes in the trophic structure and changes in the
#'  functional diversity of fish in the ecosystem.
#'
#'  Other useful biomass \eqn{(B)} ratios indicators include:
#'  \deqn{B_{invertebrates}/B_{demersal}} and \deqn{B_{pelagic}/B_{demersal}}
#'@inheritParams resourcePotential
#'@param X A dataframe of fishery independent survey data or model output with
#'  columns \code{YEAR}, \code{ID}, \code{SPECIES}, and \code{BIOMASS}.
#'  \code{YEAR} indicates the year the observation was recorded, \code{ID} is an
#'  area code indicating where the observation was recorded, \code{SPECIES} is a
#'  numeric code indicating the species sampled, and \code{BIOMASS} is the
#'  corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for catchability as
#'  required).
#'@param ratio.groups A dataframe with two columns, which must be named
#'  \code{group1} and \code{group2}. Each row holds the group names for one
#'  biomass ratio, with the numerator in column \code{group1} and the
#'  denominator in column \code{group2}. Each entry must be a character string
#'  matching the name of a column in \code{species.table} or \code{"ALL"}.
#'@param species.table A table with column names that match the entries of
#'  \code{ratio.groups}. The entries in each column are the species codes from
#'  \code{X} indicating which species are included that group.
#'  \code{species.table} may also include columns for other species groups;
#'  these will be ignored. Note that an entry in \code{ratio.groups} could be
#'  \code{"ALL"}. In this case, a column in \code{species.table} named
#'  \code{"ALL"} is not required; the function will automatically include all
#'  species in \code{X}.
#'@return Returns a dataframe with columns \code{ID} and \code{YEAR}, and a
#'  column for each biomass ratio, named after the entries in ratio.groups, e.g.
#'  \code{group1_group2}.
#'
#'  If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
#'  values is assigned \code{NA}.
