#'@title Calculates the biomass ratio between two species groups
#'@description This function calculates the biomass ratio between two
#'  pre-defined species groups for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
#'@details One useful biomass ratio is the proportion of predatory fish in the
#'  community, which is estimated by: \deqn{PropPred = Biomass Predatory Fish
#'  Surveyed/Total Biomass Surveyed} Predatory fish species are defined as all
#'  surveyed fish species that are not largely planktivorous, ie., fish that are
#'  piscivorous, or that feed on invertebrates larger than the macrozooplankton
#'  category (0.2 cm; Shin et al. 2010). Phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus
#'  feeders should be excluded. This indicator captures changes in the trophic
#'  structure and changes in the functional diversity of fish in the ecosystem.
#'
#'  Other useful biomass \eqn{(B)} ratios indicators include:
#'  \deqn{B_{invertebrates}/B_{demersal}} and \deqn{B_{pelagic}/B_{demersal}}
#'
#'  Recommended data: Fishery independent survey data or model output; fish and
#'  invertebrates.
#'@inheritParams resourcePotential
#'@param X A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
#'  "ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates the year the observation
#'  was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the observation was
#'  recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species sampled, and
#'  "BIOMASS" is the corresponding biomass (stratified and corrected for
#'  catchability as required).
#'@param group1  A character string indicating which species to include in the
#'  numerator. Must match the name of a column in species.table.
#'@param group2  A character string indicating which species to include in the
#'  denominator. Must be "ALL" or match the name of a column in species.table.
#'@param species.table A table with at least one column, named after the string
#'  group1. The entries in column group1 are the species codes for the species
#'  included in this group. If group2 is not "ALL", an additional column in
#'  species.table is required. This column is named after the string group2, and
#'  entries are the species codes for the species included in this group.
#'  Species codes should be a subset of those in the "SPECIES" column of X.
#'  species.table may also include columns for other species groups; these will
#'  be ignored.
#'@return Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. "ID", "YEAR", and "group1_group2".
#'
#'  If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
#'  values is assigned NA.
