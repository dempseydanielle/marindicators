#'@title Calculates the Large Fish Indicator (Greenstreet and Rogers, 2006)
#'@description This function calculates the Large Fish Indicator (LFI) for
#'  \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
#'@details Large Fish Indicator (LFI): \deqn{LFI = \Sigma B_m(L >50 cm)/\Sigma
#'  B_m} \eqn{B_m} is biomass of individuals in a body size class centred at
#'  mass m, and \eqn{L} is the length (cm) of an individual. This indicator
#'  describes the proportion (by weight) of the fish community that is larger
#'  than some length threshold (default here is 35 cm, i.e., the proportion of
#'  biomass occupying the top predator trophic level).
#'
#'  Recommended data: Fishery independent survey data or model output; fish.
#'@inheritParams resourcePotential
#'@param X A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
#'  "ID", "SPECIES", "LENGTH", and "ABUNDANCE". "YEAR" indicates the year the
#'  observation was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the
#'  observation was recorded, and "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the
#'  species sampled. "LENGTH" is the length class (cm) and "ABUNDANCE" is the
#'  corresponding abundance at length (stratified and corrected for catchability
#'  as required). Species for which there are no length data should be assigned
#'  LENGTH = -99. These observations are removed by the function.
#'@param large.fish threshold for large fish (cm). Default is 35 cm (i.e., large
#'  fish are those with X$LENGTH >= 35 cm)
#'@return Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. "ID", "YEAR", and
#'  "LargeFishIndicator".
#'
#'  If there are no observations of large fish or no observations in X for
#'  spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator value is assigned NA.
