#'@title Calculates the Large Fish Indicator
#'@description This function calculates the Large Fish Indicator (LFI) for
#'  \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
#'@details Large Fish Indicator (LFI): \deqn{LFI = \Sigma B_m(L >35 cm)/\Sigma
#'  B_m} \eqn{B_m} is biomass of individuals in a body size class centred at
#'  mass m, and \eqn{L} is the length (cm) of an individual. This indicator
#'  describes the proportion (by weight) of the fish community that is larger
#'  than some length threshold (default here is 35 cm, i.e., the proportion of
#'  biomass occupying the top predator trophic level; Greenstreet and Rogers,
#'  2006).

#'@param X_length A dataframe of fishery independent data derived from research
#'  vessel survey data or model output, with columns \code{YEAR}, \code{ID},
#'  \code{SPECIES}, \code{LENGTH}, and \code{BIOMASS}. \code{YEAR} indicates the
#'  year the observation was recorded, \code{ID} is an area code indicating
#'  where the observation was recorded, and \code{SPECIES} is a numeric code
#'  indicating the species sampled. \code{LENGTH} is the length class (cm) and
#'  \code{BIOMASS} is the corresponding abundance at length (stratified and
#'  corrected for catchability as required). Species for which there are no
#'  length data should be assigned \code{LENGTH = -99}. These observations are
#'  removed by the function.
#'@param group  character string indicating which species to include in the
#'  indicator calculation. If \code{group = "ALL"}, all species will be
#'  included; otherwise, \code{group} should match a column name in
#'  \code{species.table}.
#'@param large.fish Threshold for large fish (cm). Default is \code{large.fish =
#'  35} (i.e., large fish are those with \code{X_length$LENGTH} >= 35 cm).
#'@return Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. \code{ID}, \code{YEAR}, and
#'  \code{LargeFishIndicator}.
#'
#'  If there are no observations of large fish or no observations in \code{X}
#'  for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator value is assigned
#'  \code{NA}.
