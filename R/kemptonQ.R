#'@title Calculates Kempton's Biodiversity Index
#'@description This function takes a dataframe of fisheries independent survey
#'  data and calculates Kempton's Biodiversity index (Q) for \eqn{j} areas and
#'  \eqn{i} years.
#'@details Kempton's Biodiversity Index \eqn{(Q)} is a relative index of biomass
#'  diversity calculated from the Kempton's Q75 index developed for expressing
#'  species diversity. This index includes those species or functional groups
#'  with a trophic level of three or higher. \deqn{Q = S*(p_2 -
#'  p_1)*log(R_2/R_1)} \eqn{S} is the total number of species or functional
#'  groups, \eqn{p_1} and  \eqn{p_2} are the lower and upper percentiles of
#'  interest and \eqn{R_1} and \eqn{R_2} are the corresponding lower and upper
#'  quartiles of the species abundance distribution. \eqn{p_1} and \eqn{p_2} are
#'  defaulted to 0.25 and 0.75, respectively.
#'
#'  **Recommended data: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates
#'@param X dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
#'  "ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS" and/or "ABUNDANCE". "ID" is an area code
#'  designating where the observation was recorded. "SPECIES" is a numeric code
#'  indicating the species sampled.
#'@param TL.table table with columns "SPECIES" and "TL", where the "SPECIES"
#'  codes match those in X, and "TL" is the corresponding trophic level.
#'@param percentiles percentiles used to determine R1 and R2. Default here is
#'  percentiles = c(0.25, 0.75).
#'@param minTL minimum trophic level for species included in the calculation.
#'  Default is minTL = 3.
#'@param  group character string indicating which species to include, either
#'  "ALL" or "FINFISH". Note that this subsetting is based on the Fisheries and
#'  Oceans Canada species codes for the Scotian Shelf. For other regions it may
#'  be prudent to subsetdata to species groups of interest prior to using the
#'  function and then choose group = "ALL". Type ?speciesgroups for more
#'  information.
#'@param metric character string indicating whether to use "BIOMASS" or
#'  "ABUNDANCE" to calculate the indicator.
#'@param years vector of years for which to calculate indicator
#'@return Returns a dataframe with 3 columns: "ID", YEAR", and "KemptonQ"
