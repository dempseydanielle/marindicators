#' @title Calculates Kempton's Biodiversity Index
#' @description This function takes a dataframe with columns **** and calculates
#'   Kempton's Biodiversity Index (Q)
#' @details Kempton's Biodiversity Index (Q): \deqn{Q = S/2*log(R_2/R_1)}
#'   \eqn{S} is the total number of species or functional groups, \eqn{R_1} and
#'   \eqn{R_2} are the lower and upper quartiles of the species abundance
#'   distribution. \eqn{Q} is a relative index of biomass diversity calculated
#'   from the Kempton's Q75 index developed for expressing species diversity.
#'   This index includes those species or functional groups with a trophic level
#'   of three or higher. \eqn{R_1} and \eqn{R_2} are defaulted to 0.25 and 0.75,
#'   respectively.
#'
#'   **Something seems fishy about how this equation is implemented or written.
#'   I think it might just be that the equation assumes that using 0.25 and 0.75
#'   (0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5 = 1/2)
#'  
#'
#'   **Recommended data: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates
#' @param X add text here
#' @param percentiles R1 and R2 are defaulted to .25 and .75 add text here
#' @param metric add text here
#' @param minTL sets a minimum trophic level for inclusion. Default is minTl =
#'   3. For all species, set minTL = 0
