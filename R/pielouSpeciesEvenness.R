#'@title Calculates Pielou's Species Evenness
#'@description This function takes a dataframe of fisheries independent survey
#'  data and calculates Pielou's Species Evenness for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i}
#'  years.
#'@details Pielou's Species Evenness: \deqn{J' = -\Sigma p_i ln( p_i )/ln(S)}
#'  \eqn{p_i} is the proportion of the total sample contributed by the i(th)
#'  species and \eqn{S} is the number of species recorded in the sample.
#'  Pielou's index is the Shannon-Weiner index computed for the sample \eqn{S}
#'  and represents a measure of evenness of the community.
#'
#'  **Recommended data: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates.
#'
#'@param X dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
#'  "ID", "SPECIES", and "BIOMASS" and/or "ABUNDANCE". "ID" is an area code
#'  designating where the observation was recorded (a string). "SPECIES" is a
#'  numeric code indicating the species sampled.
#'@param group character string indicating which species to include, either
#'  "ALL" or "FINFISH". Note that this subsetting is based on the Fisheries and
#'  Oceans Canada species codes for the Scotian Shelf. For other regions it may
#'  be prudent to subsetdata to species groups of interest prior to using the
#'  function and then choose group = "ALL". Type ?speciesgroups for more
#'  information.
#'@param metric character string indicating whether to use "BIOMASS" or
#'  "ABUNDANCE" to calculate the indicator.
#'@param years vector of years for which to calculate indicator.
#'@return Returns a dataframe with 3 columns: "ID", YEAR", and "PielouEvenness"
