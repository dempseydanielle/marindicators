#' @title Calculates Pielou's Species Evenness
#' @description This function takes a dataframe with columns **** and calculates
#'   Pielou's Species Evenness.
#' @details Pielou's Species Evenness: \deqn{J' = -\Sigma p_i ln( p_i )/ln(S)}
#'   \eqn{p_i} is the proportion of the total sample contributed by the i(th)
#'   species and \eqn{S} is the number of species recorded in the sample.
#'   Pielou's index is the Shannon-Weiner index computed for the sample \eqn{S}
#'   and represents a measure of evenness of the community.
#'
#'   **Recommended data: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates.
#'
#' @param X is probably a dataframe with certain columns.
#' @param group is where you select which groups to include
#' @param metric is where you choose if you want to calculate using biomass or
#'   abundance
