#'@title Calculates the mean length of the community weighted by biomass or
#'  abundance (Shin et al., 2010)
#'@description This function calculates the mean length of the community
#'  weighted by biomass or abundance for \eqn{j} areas and \eqn{i} years.
#'@details \deqn{MeanLength = \Sigma(Length_m * metric_i)/\Sigma metric_j} where
#'  \eqn{Length_m} is the length (cm) of an individual in size class \eqn{m},
#'  \eqn{B_i} is the biomass or abundance of species \eqn{i} and \eqn{metric_j}
#'  is the total biomass or abundance of the community.
#'
#'  Recommended data: Fishery independent survey data or model output; fish and
#'  invertebrates.
#'@inheritParams resourcePotential
#'@param X A dataframe of fishery independent survey data with columns "YEAR",
#'  "ID", "SPECIES", "LENGTH", "ABUNDANCE", and/or "BIOMASS". "YEAR" indicates
#'  the year the observation was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where
#'  the observation was recorded, and "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the
#'  species sampled. "LENGTH" is the length class (cm) and "ABUNDANCE" and
#'  "BIOMASS" are the corresponding abundance and biomass at length (stratified
#'  and corrected for catchability as required). Species for which there are no
#'  length data should be assigned LENGTH = -99. These observations are removed
#'  by the function.
#'@return Returns a dataframe with 3 columns. "ID", "YEAR", and
#'  "MeanLength_metric".
#'
#'  If there is no data for spatial scale \eqn{j} in year \eqn{i}, indicator
#'  value is assigned NA.
