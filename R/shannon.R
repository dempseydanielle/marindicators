#' @title Calculates Shannon's index of diversity (H')
#' @description This function takes a dataframe with columns **** and calculates
#'   Shannon's diversity index.
#' @details Shannon diversity index (H'): \deqn{H' = -\Sigma p_i ln(p_i)}
#'   \eqn{p_i} is the proportion of the total sample contributed by the i(th)
#'   species and \eqn{S} is the number of species recorded in the sample. This
#'   index is sensitive to the number of species recorded in the sample.
#'
#'   Recommended data: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates.
#' @param X is probably a dataframe with certain columns.
#' @param group is where you select which groups to include
#' @param metric is where you choose if you want to calculate using biomass or
#'   abundance
