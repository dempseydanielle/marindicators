#'@title Calculates the landings per fished group
#'@description This function calculates the the catch of predefined speceies
#'  groups from commercial fisheries that is landed ashore for \eqn{j} areas and
#'  \eqn{i} years.
#'@details Calculates the total landings of predefined species groups.
#'
#'  Recommended data: commercial fisheries landings
#'@inheritParams resourcePotential
#'@param land A dataframe of commercial landings data with columns "YEAR", "ID",
#'  "SPECIES" and "CATCH". "YEAR" indicates the year the landing
#'  was recorded, "ID" is an area code indicating where the landing was
#'  recorded, "SPECIES" is a numeric code indicating the species landed, and
#'  "CATCH" is the corresponding landed weight.
#'@return returns a dataframe with three columns: "ID", "YEAR", and
#'  "group_Landings".
#'
#'  If there is no data for a given year, the indicator value is set to 0.
