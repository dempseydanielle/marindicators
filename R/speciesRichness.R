#' @title Calculates species richness (\eqn{S_y})
#' @description This function takes a dataframe with columns **** and calculates
#'   species richness.
#' @details Species richness (\eqn{S_y}) is the count of the number of species
#'   recorded in all trawl catches collected year \eqn{y}.
#'
#'   Recommended data: Fishery independent surveys, fish and invertebrates
#'
#' @param X is probably a dataframe with certain columns.
#' @param group is where you select which groups to include
#' @param grps not sure what this is because it is NOT called inside the
#'   function
#' @family biodiversity indicators
