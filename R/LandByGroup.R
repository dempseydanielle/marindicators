#'@title Calculates the landings per fished group
#'@description This function calculates the the catch of predefined speceies
#'  groups from commercial fisheries that is landed ashore for \eqn{j} areas and
#'  \eqn{i} years.
#'@details Calculates the total landings of predefined species groups.
#'
#'  Recommended data: commercial fisheries landings
#'@param land dataframe of commercial landings data with columns "YEAR", "ID",
#'  "ALLCODES" and "CATCH". "ID" is an area code designating where the
#'  observation was recorded. "ALLCODES" is a numeric commercial species code
#'  indicating the species landed, and "CATCH" is the corresponding landed
#'  weight. Additional columns are required for each species group of interest.
#'  These columns have value of "1" in the rows of species included in the group
#'  and "NA" in all other rows.
#'@param group string indicating the species group for which to calculate the
#'  landings. Should match one of the column names of land. If group = "ALL" the
#'  total landings of all species will be calculated.
#'@param years vector of years for which to calculate indicator
#'@return returns a dataframe with three columns: "ID", "YEAR", and
#'  "group_Landings".
#'
#'  If there is no data for a given year, the indicator value is set to 0.
