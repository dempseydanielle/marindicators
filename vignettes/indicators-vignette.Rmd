# Motivation
A comprehensive evaluation and selection of robust ecological indicators is one of the key steps in the process of implementing an Ecosystem Approach to fisheries management and to track progress towards meeting ecosystem goals. The "Guidance framework for the selection and evaluation of ecological indicators" (Bundy, Gomez, and Cook, 2017) developed an Indicator Selection Guidance Framework (Fig. 1) to select and evaluate potential indicators for ecosystem monitoring and assessment at different spatial scales using established selection criteria. 

![Figure 1. Indicator Selection Guidance Framework](Figure1.png)

The framework was successfully tested for the Scotian Shelf Biogregion. In Step 1, four ecosystem attributes and one pressure were defined: Biodiversity, Ecosystem Structure and Functioning, Ecosystem Stability and Resistance to Perturbations, Resource Potential, and Fishing Pressure. In Step 2, over 100 indicators were selected to represent these attributes and pressure. The qualitative screening in Step 3 reduced this set to 68 indicators, which were calculated in Step 4 (Table 1). The quantitative screening in Step 5 resulted in a final suite of 30 non-redundant ecological and fishing pressure indicators derived from fisheries independent and dependent data (Table 1; Step 6). For more information, including attribute and sub-attribute definitions and the methods used to select the final suite of indicators, please refer to the Guidance Framework document (Bundy, Gomez, and Cook, 2017).

The `indicators` package provides functions to calculate the suite of marine ecosystem indicators calculated in Step 4 of the Guidance Framework (Table 1; Bundy, Gomez, and Cook, 2017). Some functions may be used to calculate additional indicators, for example by specifying different species groups or using alternative values for arguments with default values.

# Data Requirements
This section describes the data required to calculate all of the indicators in Table 1. If some data are unavailable, a subset of indicators can be calculated.

## Fishery independent data
**X** is a dataframe of fishery independent survey data or model output with columns `YEAR`, `ID`, `SPECIES`, and `ABUNDANCE` and/or `BIOMASS` (depending on which indicator is being calculated). `YEAR` indicates the year the observation was recorded, `ID` is an area code indicating where the observation was recorded, `SPECIES` is a numeric code indicating the species sampled, and `ABUNDANCE`/`BIOMASS` is the corresponding abundance/biomass (stratified and corrected for catchability as required).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
X1 <- X[X$YEAR == 2014 & X$ID == "AREA1", ]
X1 <- X1[1:n.show,]

X2 <- X[X$YEAR == 2014 & X$ID == "AREA2", ]
X2 <- X2[1:n.show, ]

X3 <- X[X$YEAR == 2015 & X$ID == "AREA1", ]
X3 <- X3[1:n.show, ]

X4 <- X[X$YEAR == 2015 & X$ID == "AREA2", ]
X4 <- X4[1:n.show, ]

X_show <- rbind(X1, X2 ,X3, X4)

X_show$BIOMASS <- formatC(X_show$BIOMASS, format = "e", digits = n.digits)
X_show$ABUNDANCE <- formatC(X_show$ABUNDANCE, format = "e", digits = n.digits)

X_show
```
Indicators calculated using `X` (among other arguments): Heip's Evenness Index, Hill's N1, Hill's N2, Kempton's Q, Margalef's Species Richness, Pielou's Species Evenness, Shannon's Diversity Index, Biomass ratio(s), Abundance/Biomass of Species Groups, Large Species Indicator, Mean Trophic Level of the Community, CV of Biomass, Mean Maximum Lifespan, Mean Maximum Length, and Fishing Pressure.


**X_length** is a dataframe of fishery independent survey data or model output with columns `YEAR`, `ID`, `SPECIES`, `LENGTH`, and `ABUNDANCE` and/or `BIOMASS` (depending on which indicator is being calculated). As with `X`, `YEAR` indicates the year the observation was recorded, `ID` is an area code indicating where the observation was recorded, and `SPECIES` is a numeric code indicating the species sampled. `LENGTH` is the length class (cm) and `ABUNDANCE`/`BIOMASS` is the corresponding abundance/biomass at length (stratified and corrected for catchability as required). Species for which there are no length data should be assigned `LENGTH = -99`. These observations are removed by the function(s).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
X_length <- X_length[-which(X_length$LENGTH == -99), ]

X1_length <- X_length[X_length$YEAR == 2014 & X_length$ID == "AREA1", ]
X1_length <- X1_length[1:n.show,]

X2_length <- X_length[X_length$YEAR == 2014 & X_length$ID == "AREA2", ]
X2_length <- X2_length[1:n.show, ]

X3_length <- X_length[X_length$YEAR == 2015 & X_length$ID == "AREA1", ]
X3_length <- X3_length[1:n.show, ]

X4_length <- X_length[X_length$YEAR == 2015 & X_length$ID == "AREA2", ]
X4_length <- X4_length[1:n.show, ]

X_length_show <- rbind(X1_length, X2_length ,X3_length, X4_length)

X_length_show$BIOMASS <- formatC(X_length_show$BIOMASS, format = "e", digits = n.digits)
X_length_show$ABUNDANCE <- formatC(X_length_show$ABUNDANCE, format = "e", digits = n.digits)
X_length_show
```

Indicators calculated using `X_length` (among other arguments): Community Condition, Large Fish Indicator, Mean Length.

## Fishery dependent data
**land** is a dataframe of fishery dependent (commercial) landings data with columns `YEAR`, `ID`, `SPECIES` and `CATCH`. `YEAR` indicates the year the landing was recorded, `ID` is an area code indicating where the landing was recorded, `SPECIES` is a numeric code indicating the species landed, and `CATCH` is the corresponding landed weight (in the same units as `BIOMASS` in `X` and `X_length`).

The species codes in `land` can be consistent with those in `X` and `X_length` or specific to commercial landings; however, they must be consistent with the additional information described below (see Species Information and Species Groups).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
land <- land[order(land$YEAR),]

land1 <- land[land$YEAR == 2014 & land$ID == "AREA1", ]
land1 <- land1[1:n.show,]

land2 <- land[land$YEAR == 2014 & land$ID == "AREA2", ]
land2 <- land2[1:n.show, ]

land3 <- land[land$YEAR == 2015 & land$ID == "AREA1", ]
land3 <- land3[1:n.show, ]

land4 <- land[land$YEAR == 2015 & land$ID == "AREA2", ]
land4 <- land4[1:n.show, ]

land_show <- rbind(land1, land2 ,land3, land4)

land_show$CATCH <- formatC(land_show$CATCH, format = "e", digits = n.digits)
land_show
```
Indicators calculated using `land` (among other arguments): Intrinsic Vulnerability Index, Fishing-in-Balance, Diversity of the Target Species, Fishing Pressure, Landings, Marine Trophic Index, and Mean Trophic Index of Landings.

## Additional Information 

### Species Information
Additional information on key species (i.e., all species for which the information is available) is required to calculate several indicators (Table 2). 

Table 2: Additional species information required to calculate given indicators. TABLE HEADER is the required name of the column containing the information in the table passed to the function.

| **SPECIES INFO** | **TABLE HEADER** |**DESCRIPTION** | **INDICATOR(S)** 
|:------------| :------------:|:--------------------------------|:----------------|
| Trophic Level | `TL` | Trophic level of species caught in fishery independent surveys | Kempton's Q[^2], Mean Trophic Level of Community, Biomass per Trophic Level | 
| Maximum Length | `MAXLENGTH` | Maximum recorded length of species caught in fisheries independent surveys | Large Species Indicator, Mean Maximum Length |
| Maximum Age | `MAXAGE` | Maximum recorded age of of species caught in fishery independent surveys | Maximum Lifespan |
| Intrinsic Vulnerability Index | `IVI` | Vulnerability of commercial species, determined by considering several traits (e.g. max length, age at first maturity, longevity, von Bertalanffy growth parameter, natural mortality, fecundity, spatial behaviour, and geographic range) | IVI of landings | 
| Trophic Level of Landed Species | `TL_LAND` | Trophic level of commercial species | Fishing-in-Balance, Marine Trophic Index, Mean Trophic Level of Landings |

[^2]: Trophic level is only required to calculate Kempton's Q if a threshold trophic level is specified (e.g., `minTL` > 0).
  
  
The species information is passed to the function through a table with at least two columns: `SPECIES` (the species codes) and the corresponding column of information, which should be named after one of the table headers in Table 2. For example:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
TL.table <- na.omit(species.info[, c("SPECIES", "TL")])
TL.table$TL <- round(TL.table$TL, digits = 3)
TL.table <- TL.table[1:(n.show*2), ]
TL.table
```

If the species codes used in `X` and `land` are the same, it may be convenient to store all of the additional information in a single table. If information is not available for a given species, assign a value of `NA`. This whole table may be passed to a function; superfluous columns will be ignored.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
species.info_show <- species.info[1:10, ]
species.info_show$TL <- round(species.info_show$TL, digits = 3)
species.info_show$TL_LAND <- round(species.info_show$TL_LAND, digits = 3)
species.info_show
```
If the species codes in `X` and `land` are not the same, then the extra information should be stored in at least two tables (e.g., `TL`, `MAXLENGTH`, and `MAXAGE` in one table, and `IVI` and `TL_LAND` in the other).

### Length-Weight data
The Community Condition indicator (based on Fulton's condition index) requires annual length-weight data for all species of interest. This table should have 5 columns: `YEAR`, `ID`, and `SPECIES` correspond with those columns in `X_length`, while `LENGTH` is fish length at the corresponding `WEIGHT` (fish weight).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Length_Weight1 <- Length_Weight[Length_Weight$YEAR == 2014 & Length_Weight$ID == "AREA1", ]
Length_Weight1 <- Length_Weight1[1:n.show,]

Length_Weight2 <- Length_Weight[Length_Weight$YEAR == 2014 & Length_Weight$ID == "AREA2", ]
Length_Weight2 <- Length_Weight2[1:n.show, ]

Length_Weight3 <- Length_Weight[Length_Weight$YEAR == 2015 & Length_Weight$ID == "AREA1", ]
Length_Weight3 <- Length_Weight3[1:n.show, ]

Length_Weight4 <- Length_Weight[Length_Weight$YEAR == 2015 & Length_Weight$ID == "AREA2", ]
Length_Weight4 <- Length_Weight4[1:n.show, ]

Length_Weight_show <- rbind(Length_Weight1, Length_Weight2 ,Length_Weight3, Length_Weight4)

Length_Weight_show
```

### Species Groups
Several functions give the user the option to choose the species group(s) for which to calculate the indicator. The groups are defined by the user in a table, called here `species.groups`. The column names of `species.groups` are the groups of interest, and the entries in each column are the codes for species that belong in that group. Both fishery independent groups (e.g., trophic guilds) and commercial groups can be included in this table, but take care to be consistent with the species codes (e.g., if there are different species codes in `X` and `land`, the fishery-independent groups should include species codes from `X`, and the commercial groups should include species codes from `land`).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
species.groups_show <- species.groups[1:(n.show*2), c(1:7)]

species.groups_show
```
Note that the user does not need to include a column with all species (i.e., all species are automatically included in the calculation if argument `group = "ALL"`).

# Application
This section describes the general use of the functions in the indicators package. See the package manual or help file for each function for more details.

Most functions calculate a single indicator, and return a dataframe with three columns: `ID`, `YEAR`, and the indicator. For example, the following function call calculates Shannon's Index of Diversity for the two areas defined by the `ID` column in `X` (`AREA` and `AREA2`) from 2014 - 2019:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shannon(X, group = "ALL", metric = "ABUNDANCE", species.table = NULL,  years = c(2014:2019))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
shan_out <- shannon(X, group = "ALL", metric = "ABUNDANCE", species.table = NULL,  years = c(2014:2019))
shan_out$ShannonDiversity <- round(shan_out$ShannonDiversity, digits = 3) 
shan_out
```

Some functions calculate more than one indicator depending on the arguments. For example, `biomassPerTL()` returns `ID` and `YEAR`, plus a column for each trophic level range specified by `TL.grouping` (see `?biomassPerTL` for more detail). For `TL.grouping = 1`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
biomassPerTL(X, TL.table = species.info, metric = "BIOMASS", TL.grouping = 1, years = c(2014:2019))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
bio_TL <- biomassPerTL(X, TL.table = species.info, metric = "BIOMASS", TL.grouping = 1, years = c(2014:2019))
bio_TL 
```
`meanTLLandings()` calculates the mean trophic level of the landings when `minTL = 0` and the mean trophic index when `minTL = 3.25`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
meanTLLandings(land, TL.table = species.info, minTL = 0, years = c(2014:2019))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
TLL <- meanTLLandings(land, TL.table = species.info, minTL = 0, years = c(2014:2019))
TLL$MeanTL.Landings <- round(TLL$MeanTL.Landings, digits = 3)
TLL
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
meanTLLandings(land, TL.table = species.info, minTL = 3.25, years = c(2014:2019))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
MTI <- meanTLLandings(land, TL.table = species.info, minTL = 3.25, years = c(2014:2019))
MTI$MTI.Landings_3.25 <- round(MTI$MTI.Landings_3.25, digits = 3)
MTI
```
Several functions (e.g., `resourcePotential()`, `biomassRatio()`, `communityCondition()`, `landings()`, and `fishingPressure()`) can return the indicator values for multiple species groups defined in `species.groups` with one function call. For example, the following function call calculates the biomass of: all species in the community, clupeids, finfish, and flatfish for two areas from 2014 - 2019.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
resource.groups <- c("ALL", "CLUPEIDS", "FINFISH", "FLATFISH")

resourcePotential(X, metric = "BIOMASS", groups = resource.groups, species.table =   
                    species.groups, years = c(2014:2019))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
resource.groups <- c("ALL", "CLUPEIDS", "FINFISH", "FLATFISH")

potential <-resourcePotential(X, metric = "BIOMASS", groups = resource.groups, species.table = species.groups, years = c(2014:2019))
potential
```

All indicators from a given attribute or pressure can be calculated with a single function call. If some data are not available, a subset of indicators can be returned.  The user can choose whether the function returns the raw indicator values, the standardized (z-score) values, or both. For example, the following call would return the raw values of 18 Structure and Functioning indicators (indicator names listed below):

```{r}
ratio.groups <- data.frame(rbind(c("PELAGIC", "GROUNDFISH"), c("PREDATORS", "ALL")))
names(ratio.groups) <- c("group1", "group2")
trophicguild.groups <- c("LBENTHIVORE", "MBENTHIVORE", "PISCIVORE", "PLANKTIVORE", "ZOOPISCIVORE")
condition.groups <- c("FINFISH", "LBENTHIVORE", "MBENTHIVORE", "PISCIVORE", "PLANKTIVORE", "ZOOPISCIVORE")

inds <- allStructure(X = X, X_length = X_length, 
             LSI.group = "ALL", LFI.group = "ALL",
             guild.groups = trophicguild.groups, condition.groups = condition.groups,
             ratio.groups = ratio.groups,
             species.table = species.groups, speciesinfo.table = species.info,
             LenWt.table = Length_Weight,
             max.length = 85, years = c(2014:2019),
             raw = TRUE, std = FALSE)
names(inds)
```
Changing the arguments to `raw = FALSE` and `std = TRUE`, the function call will return the standarized versions of the same Structure and Functioning indicators (denoted with `_s` in the indicator name):

```{r}
inds_std <- allStructure(X = X, X_length = X_length, 
             LSI.group = "ALL", LFI.group = "ALL",
             guild.groups = trophicguild.groups, condition.groups = condition.groups,
             ratio.groups = ratio.groups,
             species.table = species.groups, speciesinfo.table = species.info,
             LenWt.table = Length_Weight,
             max.length = 85, years = c(2014:2019),
             raw = FALSE, std = TRUE)
names(inds_std)
```

Finally, the function `extractAll()` can calculate all indicators. The user can choose whether the function returns the indicator dataframe to the global environment, or exports the dataframe to a csv file. The user can also choose whether the function returns the raw indicator values, the standaradized (z-score) values, or both. For example, the following function call calculates 53 standardized indicators and returns them to the global environment in variable `all_inds`.

```{r}
landings.groups <- c("ALL", "CLUPEIDS.L", "FLATFISH.L", "GROUNDFISH.L")
FP.groups <- data.frame(rbind(c("ALL", "ALL"), 
   c("CLUPEIDS", "CLUPEIDS.L"),
   c("FLATFISH", "FLATFISH.L"),
   c("GROUNDFISH", "GROUNDFISH.L")))
names(FP.groups) <- c("group.X", "group.land")

all_inds <- extractAll(X = X, X_length = X_length, land = land,
           speciesinfo.table = species.info, 
           species.table = species.groups, 
           LenWt.table = Length_Weight,
           metric.bio = "ABUNDANCE", group.bio = "ALL", minTL.bio = 3,
           LSI.group = "ALL", LFI.group = "ALL",
           guild.groups = trophicguild.groups,
           resource.groups = resource.groups, condition.groups = condition.groups, 
           ratio.groups = ratio.groups,
           max.length = 85,  maxlength.group = "FINFISH", 
           TL.grouping = 1, wind = 5, negative = TRUE,
           minTL.FiB = 0, base.start = 2014, base.end = 2015,
           landings.groups = landings.groups, FP.groups = FP.groups, 
           minTL.FP = c(0, 3.25),
           years = c(2014:2019), 
           raw = FALSE, std = TRUE, export.path = NULL)

names(all_inds)

```

## Missing Data
If there are no observations for a given year in `X`, `X_length` or `land`, the indicator value is assigned `NA` or `0`. We recognize that even if a species is not detected during the fishery independent survey, it may still be present in the community. All indicators calculated from `X` and `X_land` are therefore assigned `NA` (rather than `0`) for years that are missing data. 

In contrast, we assume that if there are no recorded commercial landings of a species, then that species was not landed. All landings indicators are therefore assigned `0` for years without data. For fishing pressure, if the biomass of the fished group is `NA` and landings of the group are `0`, the fishing pressure is set to `0`. Otherwise, if biomass of the fished group is `NA`, fishing pressure is set to `NA`.

Other indicators that are calculated from `land` are assigned `NA` for years without observations (e.g., intrinsic vulnerability index, Fishing-in-Balance, Diversity of Target Species, Marine Trophic Index, Mean Trophic Level of Landings).
